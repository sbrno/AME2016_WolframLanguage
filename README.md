# The 2016 Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2016) data using Wolfram Language (Mathematica)

This is a notebook with a parser for AME2016 data file. The first AME2016 data file is also included in this repository. 
The notebook also has a mini-study comparing the data in AME2016 file and in Wolfram Language.

## Introduction

The brief description of the data is:

As a fundamental property of nuclei, atomic masses are widely used in many domains of science and engineering. A reliable atomic mass table derived from the experimental data, where the atomic masses and the relevant experimental information can be found conveniently, is in high demand by the research community. To meet the demands, the Atomic Mass Evaluation (Ame) was created in 1950's and now serves the research community by providing the most reliable and comprehensive information related to the atomic masses. (G. Audi, Int. J. Mass Spectr.251: 85 (2006) http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijms.2006.01.04)

This data represents the newest published one in 2016. It is called AME2016.

The data represents: Atomic mass list for analysis. This list contains the elements, mass excess, binding energy, beta-decay energy, atomic mass and more.

The data itself can be found at Atomic Mass Data Center (AMDC) website: http://amdc.impcas.ac.cn/index.html | http://amdc.impcas.ac.cn/web/masseval.html
